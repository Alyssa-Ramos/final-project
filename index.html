      <div class="socImp">
        <p>Several Asian countries like Thailand, Cambodia or China have felt the pressured to compete regionally because of the high demand for cheaply made goods. Many manufacturers have used this an excuse to bypass labor laws. </p>

<!-- 3.3 Environmental Implications  -->
<div id="environ" class="slideB">
  <h2> The Environmental Implications </h2>
    <h3> Landfills: Where clothes go to die </h3>
      <p> It's purported that the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/07/26/fast-fashion-is-a-disa ster  -for-women-and-the-environment/#250ff18d1fa4"> U.S. generates around 16.22 million tons </a>  of diposed textiles in 2014.  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/07/26/fast-fashion-is-a-disa ster  -for-women-and-the-environment/#250ff18d1fa4"> Only 2.62 million tons of textiles were recycled </a>. Because most clothing is made of synthetic, petroleum-based fibers, it takes decades for them to decompose. Moreover, the chemical dye from these clothings can seep into the soil and pollute the groundwater. It's also predicted that fashion industry's C02 emmissions will increase by 60 percent. </p>

      <h3> Water shortages </h3>
        <p> In order to manufacture clothing, especially those made of cotton, require a large amount of water. This is detrimental for countries like India and China, which are experiencing <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/07/26/fast-fashion-is-a-di  saster  -for-women-and-the-environment/#250ff18d1fa4"> major water shortages </a>.</p>

<!-- 4.0 Why it happens  -->
<div id="why" class="slideP">
<h2> What drives fast fashion? </h2>
  <h3> Low quality > High value clothing </h3>
    <p> The fast fashion model produces large amounts of cheap clothing that follows trends coming off the runways. The industry has created this insatiable demand for new designs and styles, and the fast fashion model continue to feed costumers' cravings. The fashion industry – generally divided into two seasons, Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter – now has "micro-seasons" where new styles come out frequently. For example, retailers like <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/shannon-whitehead/5-truths-the-fast-fashion_b _5690575.html"> Zara and Forever 21 receive shipments of new clothing weekly and daily </a>, respectively.</p>
    <!-- https://www.huffingtonpost.com/shannon-whitehead/5-truths-the-fast-fashion_b _5690575.html -->

  <h3> E-commerce is now entertainment </h3>
    <p> With the rise of e-commerce, shopping can be done instantenously at the swipe of a thumb anywhere, anytime. Retailers like Top Shop introduce around 400 styles to their website often. E-commerce has increased the demand for clothing and apps like Pinterest have made retail a form of entertainment.  Accordingt o [link here], 45 percent of Millenials spend more than hour looking at retail sites everyday. A study has shown that there is more brain activity in a part of the brain called the medial prefrontal cortex. This acivity is registered as pleasure that derives from getting a good deal on clothing that balances the hedonistic need to buy clothing and the pain of making an expensive purchase. </p>

  <h3> Discounts aren't always deals </h3>
    <p> Many people love fast fashion because of its extremely cheap prices and the deals that retailers offer. Brands like H&amp;M and outlets for brands like J.Crew, mark down their prices while customers think they're paying high-quality designer brands for a much affordable price. It seems like a steal, but in reality, some outlets broker deals with desingers to sell lesser, poor-quality versions of their products. </p>
