Week 1

For my first week, a lot of the process was diligently setting up all of the content and the elements for the web application. Overall, I think I did a good job of setting up and organizing my final project, so that I won't be confused as I move forward with more complex elements.

For example, I drew out a rough sketch of how I wanted my website to look like. Afterward, I outlined how I wanted the information to appear on a google doc. In the google doc, I listed researched what statistics and what content I wanted to include. So far, I have created the html markup for all content, included images and included links.

I'm especially pleased that I set up the leaflet map correctly in my html. Every time I had a snag in creating my website, I was very glad I knew how to troubleshoot the minor problems. Any major issues I had stemmed from the Javascript â€“ although, I expected that. I tried to include a switch function so that when the user selects an item from the drop down box, it will alert a pop up marker from the map that corresponds with that country. I put the main Jquery functions in my javascript document, but I feel like I got the syntax incorrectly. I also think that I'm supposed to include some sort of change function. I also wonder if I'm allowed to use the id attribute on the select element.

I referred to the textbook and some example <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/macloo/Lvs6y8jp/"> jfiddles </a> that Professor McAdams included in addition to other websites to see where I went wrong. Here are other links I referred to:

https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/eff_show.asp
https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_select.asp
https://api.jquery.com/change/


I'm going to continue researching jfiddles for syntax and play with the jfiddle examples again. However, I will move forward with the other javascript functions I wanted to add while playing around with the function I wanted to include for the worldmap.

For true or false?

Week 2


While last week was compiling my content together, this I spent a couple of hours sorting through my Javascript functions and organizing my content. I'm pleased that my I was able to organize my divs so that they can appear as slides with large backgrounds with either solid colors or images, which I've organized by styling.

I was also able to make two of my "slides" perform slide toggle functions, specific to the sections on fast fashion's social and environmental implications. This way the user can click on each of the subheadings to read more about it. I will style the headings so that its clear to the user to click on them.

Aside from that my biggest challenge has been to create the functions for my map. I was able to use a switch function connect to my drop down menu, so that the user can have maps pop up according to what country they chose. I had to use a different JQuery function instead that didn't use attributes but values. I was able to get the maps to show, but the biggest issue is getting the maps to replace each other  on the page. Instead they're on the page, but they're hidden, so the view port of the screen is much bigger than it needs to be because its hiding the maps. Also, you can't make the maps hide, once you click on more than one option at a time. I'm gonna try doing a show and hide instead.
