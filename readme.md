Week 1

For my first week, a lot of the process was diligently setting up all of the content and the elements for the web application. Overall, I think I did a good job of setting up and organizing my final project, so that I won't be confused as I move forward with more complex elements.

For example, I drew out a rough sketch of how I wanted my website to look like. Afterward, I outlined how I wanted the information to appear on a google doc. In the google doc, I listed researched what statistics and what content I wanted to include. So far, I have created the html markup for all content, included images and included links.

I'm especially pleased that I set up the leaflet map correctly in my html. Every time I had a snag in creating my website, I was very glad I knew how to troubleshoot the minor problems. Any major issues I had stemmed from the Javascript â€“ although, I expected that. I tried to include a switch function so that when the user selects an item from the drop down box, it will alert a pop up marker from the map that corresponds with that country. I put the main Jquery functions in my javascript document, but I feel like I got the syntax incorrectly. I also think that I'm supposed to include some sort of change function. I also wonder if I'm allowed to use the id attribute on the select element.

I referred to the textbook and some example <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/macloo/Lvs6y8jp/"> jfiddles </a> that Professor McAdams included in addition to other websites to see where I went wrong. Here are other links I referred to:

https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/eff_show.asp
https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_select.asp
https://api.jquery.com/change/


I'm going to continue researching jfiddles for syntax and play with the jfiddle examples again. However, I will move forward with the other javascript functions I wanted to add while playing around with the function I wanted to include for the worldmap.

For true or false?
